- Tenant-scoped queries enforced at ORM level
- Zero-trust principle: every query validates tenant scope

**Authentication Strategy (First Principles - Use Proven Libraries):**
- NextAuth.js or Clerk for auth (don't build from scratch)
- OAuth 2.0 (Google) in Epic 1, SAML 2.0 (Okta, Azure AD) deferred to Epic 5
- MFA (TOTP) via authenticator apps
- Session management with JWT tokens

**RBAC Design (6 Personas from Stakeholder Mapping):**
- Owner/Admin: Full org control
- PM/CSM: Project oversight, dashboard access
- QA-Manual: Manual test execution, defect filing
- QA-Automation: Agent selection, automated execution, self-healing approval
- Dev: Read-only test results, GitHub PR integration
- Viewer: Read-only dashboards and reports

### Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Foundation Scope Creep (From Pre-mortem)**
- **Scenario:** Epic 1 bloats to 8+ weeks with "just one more auth feature"
- **Impact:** Delays all subsequent epics, no user value for 2 months
- **Mitigation:** Strict 10-12 story limit enforced. OAuth SAML, advanced RBAC, billing UI deferred to Epic 5.

**Risk 2: Multi-Tenancy Bugs (From Risk Matrix - CRITICAL)**
- **Scenario:** Tenant isolation fails, Customer A sees Customer B's data
- **Impact:** Trust destroyed, regulatory violations, customer exodus
- **Mitigation:**
  - Schema-level isolation (PostgreSQL schemas per tenant)
  - Automated daily audit: scan logs for cross-tenant queries
  - Manual QA: test with 3 tenants, verify strict isolation

**Risk 3: Onboarding Friction (From Journey Mapping)**
- **Scenario:** Signup/org setup confusing, 50% abandonment rate
- **Impact:** Platform adoption blocked before Epic 2 value delivered
- **Mitigation:**
  - Onboarding wizard (guided flow: Signup → Org Setup → Team Invite → Project Creation)
  - User testing with 5 real users before Epic 2 starts
  - Analytics tracking: measure completion rate, identify drop-off points

### Epic Completion Criteria

Before moving to Epic 2, Epic 1 must achieve:
- ✅ All 10-12 stories 100% complete (acceptance criteria met)
- ✅ Demo-able: Owner/Admin can complete full onboarding flow (signup → org → invite → project) in <10 minutes
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation validated: 3 test tenants, no cross-tenant data leakage
- ✅ Regression tests passing (auth, RBAC, project CRUD)
- ✅ Deployed to staging environment
- ✅ Documentation updated (README, API docs for auth endpoints)

### Key Architectural Decisions

**AI Agent Platform Architecture (From Value Chain Analysis - High-Value Investment):**
- LangChain for MVP (fast development), plan custom orchestrator for production
- 3 MVP agents only (BAConsultant AI Agent, QAConsultant AI Agent, AutomationConsultant AI Agent)
- 4 Post-MVP agents deferred to Epic 6+ (AI Log Reader/Summarizer, Security Scanner Orchestrator, Performance/Load Agent, DatabaseConsultant AI Agent)
- Agent outputs stored as JSON artifacts (versioned, editable)

**LLM Cost & Latency Mitigation (From Pre-mortem & Risk Matrix - CRITICAL):**
- **Token Budget Enforcement:** Hard limits per tenant (configurable by tier: Free=1K tokens/day, Pro=10K, Enterprise=100K)
- **Aggressive Caching:** Redis cache for LLM responses (24h TTL, cache key = prompt hash)
- **Prompt Optimization:** Reduce agent chain calls from 15 → 5 maximum
- **Streaming Responses:** Show agent progress in real-time (not blank "Generating..." spinner)
- **Self-Hosted Fallback:** Ollama dev environment, plan vLLM production (deferred to Epic 6+)
- **Cost Monitoring Dashboard:** Real-time token usage per tenant, alert at 80% budget

**Vector Database Strategy (From Pre-mortem - Vendor Independence):**
- Abstraction layer: `VectorStore` interface supporting multiple providers
- MVP: pgvector (PostgreSQL extension, no vendor lock-in)
- Alternative: Pinecone or Weaviate if pgvector performance insufficient
- Embeddings stored in portable format (can migrate providers)

**Document Parsing Strategy (From Risk Matrix - Medium Risk):**
- PDF: PyPDF2 for MVP (known quirks with complex layouts)
- Word: python-docx for .docx parsing
- Markdown: Direct text extraction (preferred format)
- Fallback: If PDF parsing fails, prompt user to upload Markdown version
- Chunking: 1000-token chunks with 200-token overlap for embeddings

**JIRA Integration Resilience (From Pre-mortem - Integration Brittleness):**
- **Dead Letter Queue:** Failed JIRA API calls queued for retry (7-day retention)
- **Exponential Backoff:** 5 retry attempts over 24 hours (1min, 5min, 30min, 2hr, 12hr)
- **Webhook Validation:** HMAC signature verification for JIRA webhooks
- **Health Monitoring:** Integration dashboard shows last sync time, error rate, status (green/yellow/red)
- **Graceful Degradation:** Platform works if JIRA down (show cached data, queue sync for later)

**PM Dashboard Architecture (From Stakeholder Mapping - High-Influence Persona):**
- Real-time metrics: Coverage % calculated from generated tests vs requirements
- Placeholder metrics for Epic 3-4: Execution velocity, defect leakage (show "Coming Soon" or sample data)
- Dashboard framework: Recharts for visualization (React charting library)
- Auto-refresh: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates (simpler than WebSocket)

- **FRs Covered:** N/A (internal cost control, preventive architecture)

### Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: LLM Cost Explosion (From Pre-mortem - CRITICAL)**
- **Scenario:** Token costs hit $5K/month for 50 tenants (unsustainable)
- **Impact:** Forced price increase 3x, customer churn
- **Mitigation:**
  - Token budgets enforced (hard limits per tenant tier)
  - Aggressive Redis caching (24h TTL, identical prompts cached)
  - Prompt optimization (reduce agent chain length)
  - Real-time cost dashboard with 80% budget alerts
  - Self-hosted LLM (Ollama) planned for Epic 6+ to reduce dependency

**Risk 2: LLM Latency & Quality (From Risk Matrix - Score 9)**
- **Scenario:** Agent execution takes 30+ seconds, outputs hallucinated/low-quality tests
- **Impact:** User abandons during "Generating..." wait, loses trust in AI
- **Mitigation:**
  - Streaming responses (show progress, not blank spinner)
  - Agent output validation (check generated tests syntactically valid, reference real FRs)
  - User testing: 10 real PRDs, validate quality before Epic 3
  - Latency target: <10 seconds for typical PRD (40-50 requirements)

**Risk 3: JIRA Integration Brittleness (From Pre-mortem - Score 7)**
- **Scenario:** JIRA API changes, sync breaks, users see stale data
- **Impact:** "Doesn't work with our tools" churn reason
- **Mitigation:**
  - Dead letter queue (7-day retention for failed syncs)
  - Exponential backoff retry (5 attempts over 24 hours)
  - Integration health dashboard (last sync time, error rate)
  - Graceful degradation (show cached JIRA data if API down)

**Risk 4: Document Parsing Failures (From Risk Matrix - Score 4)**
- **Scenario:** Complex PDF layouts (tables, images) parsed incorrectly, AI gets bad input
- **Impact:** Test generation quality suffers, coverage incomplete
- **Mitigation:**
  - Support Markdown upload as fallback (preferred format)
  - Parse error handling: Show preview, prompt user to verify text extraction
  - Chunking strategy prevents loss (1000-token chunks with overlap)

**Risk 5: Vector DB Vendor Lock-In (From Pre-mortem - Score 4)**
- **Scenario:** pgvector performance insufficient at scale, forced to migrate to Pinecone
- **Impact:** 2-week migration project mid-sprint
- **Mitigation:**
  - `VectorStore` abstraction layer (interface supports multiple providers)
  - Embeddings stored in portable JSON format
  - Quarterly review: benchmark pgvector vs alternatives

### Epic Completion Criteria

Before moving to Epic 3, Epic 2 must achieve:
- ✅ All 15-18 stories 100% complete
- ✅ Demo-able: Upload PRD → Select agents → Generate tests → View coverage matrix in <10 minutes
- ✅ Quality validation: 10 real PRDs tested, 100+ test scenarios generated per PRD (average)
- ✅ JIRA integration: Import 100+ issues, bi-directional sync working, health dashboard green
- ✅ PM dashboard: Real coverage % calculated and displayed
- ✅ LLM costs: <$1.00 per test generation run (average), token budget alerts configured
- ✅ Performance: Agent execution <10 seconds P95 latency
- ✅ Regression tests: Epic 1 still works (auth, org, projects)
- ✅ Deployed to staging

- ✅ View defects filed: "3 new P1 bugs created in JIRA from failed manual tests"
- ✅ Observe QA team productivity increase (evidence capture faster than separate tools)

**"5-Minute Wow Moment" Achieved:**
- Upload PRD (Epic 2) → Select agents (Epic 2) → Generate tests (Epic 2) → Execute manually (Epic 3) → File defect to JIRA (Epic 3) → See results in GitHub PR (Epic 3) = Complete end-to-end workflow in <10 minutes total

**Success Criteria:**
- QA-Manual executes 8-step test in <5 minutes (including evidence capture)
- Screenshot capture works on Windows/Mac/Linux (cross-platform validated)
- Defect created in JIRA from failed step in <30 seconds (one-click flow)
- GitHub PR comments show test results within 2 minutes of test completion
- GitHub webhook delivery >95% success rate (monitored, dead letter queue for failures)

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Manual Execution Interface (From UX Design - Flow 3):**
- Split-screen layout: Test steps (60% width) | Evidence capture (40% width)
- Current step highlighted in blue background
- Keyboard shortcuts: P = Pass, F = Fail, S = Skip, Spacebar = Screenshot, Enter = Next
- Auto-save progress (test resumable if browser crashes)
- Timer shows execution duration

**Evidence Capture Strategy (From Risk Matrix - Medium Risk):**
- **Screenshots:** Playwright browser automation (capture active window) - works cross-platform
- **Video:** Browser MediaRecorder API (screen capture permission required)
- **Storage:** S3-compatible object storage (MinIO for self-hosted, AWS S3 for cloud)
- **Compression:** Images WebP format (smaller than PNG), Video H.264 codec (limit 720p resolution)
- **Size Limits:** Max 25MB per screenshot, 500MB per video (enforce to control storage costs)

**JIRA Defect Auto-Creation (From Journey Mapping - QA-Manual Pain Point):**
- Inline defect form pre-filled:
  - Summary: Test name + step number ("Login fails at Step 8: Enter credentials")
  - Description: Expected vs Actual + test context
  - Attachments: All screenshots/videos from execution auto-attached
  - JIRA project & issue type: User selects from dropdown (defaults to last used)
- "Create in JIRA" checkbox (default on)
- "Also create in QUALISYS" checkbox (internal defect tracking, default off)
- Created defect linked: Test case ↔ JIRA issue (FR48 traceability)

**GitHub Integration Architecture (From Pre-mortem - Integration Resilience):**
- **Webhook Setup:** GitHub App or webhook configured to send events (push, pull_request)
- **Webhook Receiver:** Dedicated endpoint `/api/webhooks/github` validates signature (HMAC SHA-256)
- **Event Processing:** Background job queues test run (PR detected → trigger automated tests from Epic 4, manual tests from Epic 3 show in comment)
- **PR Comment Format:**
  ```

- AC4: Comment includes: Passed count, Failed count, Skipped count, Duration, Failed test details, Link to full report
- AC5: Comment posted within 2 minutes of test completion
- AC6: If API call fails → Dead letter queue (retry with exponential backoff)
- **FRs Covered:** FR92, FR95

**Story 3.12: GitHub PR Status Check & Merge Gate**
As a Dev/PM, I want test results to control PR merge gates, so that broken code doesn't merge.
- AC1: Settings → GitHub Integration → "Enable Merge Gate" checkbox
- AC2: If enabled: GitHub status check created (context: "QUALISYS Tests")
- AC3: Test run started → Status: Pending (yellow dot in GitHub PR)
- AC4: Tests pass → Status: Success (green checkmark, merge button enabled)
- AC5: Tests fail → Status: Failure (red X, merge blocked with message "Tests must pass")
- AC6: "Override" option available (requires justification, logged in audit trail)
- **FRs Covered:** FR93

**Story 3.13: Cross-Platform Evidence Capture Testing**
As QA, I want to validate evidence capture works on Windows/Mac/Linux, so that all users can capture screenshots/video.
- AC1: Test matrix: Windows 10/11, macOS 12+, Ubuntu 20.04+
- AC2: Screenshot capture: Validate Playwright works on all platforms
- AC3: Video capture: Validate browser MediaRecorder API permissions and recording
- AC4: Evidence upload to S3: Validate from all platforms
- AC5: Regression tests: Automated tests for evidence capture (headless browsers)
- **FRs Covered:** N/A (QA validation task)

**Story 3.14: Manual Test Execution Performance Optimization**
As a QA-Manual tester, I want fast UI response, so that testing feels smooth.
- AC1: Step navigation: <100ms response time (pass/fail/skip button click → next step displayed)
- AC2: Screenshot capture: <2 seconds (click → thumbnail appears)
- AC3: Video upload: Background upload (doesn't block test execution)
- AC4: Auto-save: <500ms debounce (notes saved without blocking)
- AC5: SSE connection: Reconnect automatically if dropped (graceful degradation)
- **FRs Covered:** N/A (performance optimization)

**Story 3.15: GitHub Integration Health Dashboard**
As an Admin, I want to monitor GitHub integration health, so that I can detect issues early.
- AC1: Integrations page → GitHub card shows health metrics:
  - Last webhook received: "2 minutes ago"
  - Webhook delivery success rate: "98.5% (197 of 200 delivered)"
  - Failed deliveries: "3 events in dead letter queue"
- AC2: Health indicator: Green (>95% success), Yellow (90-95%), Red (<90%)
- AC3: "View Failed Events" button shows dead letter queue with retry buttons
- AC4: Alert configured: Email if success rate <90% over 1-hour window
- **FRs Covered:** N/A (integration resilience, preventive architecture)

### Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Evidence Capture Cross-Platform Failures (From Risk Matrix - Score 4-5)**
- **Scenario:** Screenshot capture fails on Linux, video recording doesn't work on older Macs
- **Impact:** QA-Manual users frustrated, evidence incomplete
- **Mitigation:**
  - Cross-platform testing matrix (Windows/Mac/Linux) before Epic 3 complete
  - Fallback: Manual upload button if screenshot capture fails
  - Browser compatibility check: Warn if browser doesn't support MediaRecorder API
  - User documentation: System requirements (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+)

**Risk 2: GitHub Webhook Delivery Failures (From Pre-mortem - Score 7)**
- **Scenario:** GitHub webhooks fail silently, tests don't trigger on PR
- **Impact:** Dev pushes code, no test feedback, broken code merges
- **Mitigation:**
  - Dead letter queue (7-day retention, manual replay capability)
  - Webhook health dashboard (last received, success rate)
  - Alert if no webhooks received in 24 hours (repo is active)
  - Manual trigger button: "Run Tests on PR #123" (fallback if webhook missed)

**Risk 3: JIRA Defect Creation Failures (From Risk Matrix - Score 7)**
- **Scenario:** JIRA API rate limit hit, defect creation fails, evidence lost
- **Impact:** QA-Manual files defect, thinks it's created, but JIRA has nothing
- **Mitigation:**
  - Retry logic: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1min, 5min, 15min)
  - If all retries fail: Save defect locally in QUALISYS (don't lose data)
  - Show warning: "JIRA defect creation failed, saved locally. Retry later?"
  - Dead letter queue for failed JIRA API calls

**Risk 4: "5-Minute Wow Moment" Demo Failures (From Six Thinking Hats - Black Hat)**
- **Scenario:** Epic 3 complete, but end-to-end demo has bugs, stakeholders unimpressed
- **Impact:** Confidence shaken, funding questioned
- **Mitigation:**
  - **"Dogfooding Sprint" (from Six Thinking Hats - Green Hat Creative Alternative):** After Epic 3 complete, 1-week sprint where team uses QUALISYS to test QUALISYS
  - Find usability issues before customer demos
  - Rehearse demo script 3x before presenting to stakeholders
  - Have fallback: Pre-recorded demo video if live demo fails

**Risk 5: Storage Costs Explosion (From Risk Matrix - Medium)**
- **Scenario:** Video files too large (1GB+ per test), storage costs spike
- **Impact:** AWS S3 bill hits $500/month unexpectedly
- **Mitigation:**
  - Video compression enforced (H.264, 720p max resolution)
  - Size limits: Max 500MB per video (warns user if exceeding)
  - Storage lifecycle: Auto-delete evidence >90 days old (configurable retention policy)
  - Storage usage dashboard: Show per-org storage consumed, alert at 80% quota

### Epic Completion Criteria

Before moving to Epic 4, Epic 3 must achieve:
- ✅ All 12-15 stories 100% complete
- ✅ **"5-Minute Wow Moment" Demo:** Upload PRD → Generate tests → Execute manually → File defect to JIRA → See GitHub PR comment - complete flow in <10 minutes

- ✅ JIRA defect creation: <30 seconds from failed step to JIRA issue created
- ✅ Performance: Step navigation <100ms, screenshot capture <2 seconds
- ✅ Dogfooding sprint complete: Team used QUALISYS to test QUALISYS for 1 week, found and fixed usability issues
- ✅ Stakeholder demo successful: Presented to 3 stakeholders (Owner, PM, QA-Manual), positive feedback
- ✅ Regression tests: Epic 1-2 still working (auth, projects, agent generation)
- ✅ Deployed to staging

- Performance: P95 test execution latency <30 seconds per test

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Self-Healing Engine Architecture (From Architecture Doc - Truth #1, Priority 2):**
- **Core Philosophy:** Self-healing is the product, not a feature. 70% of AI/ML engineering effort allocated here.
- **Dedicated Service:** SelfHealingEngine as standalone service (not feature layer in test runner)
- **Multi-Strategy Locator System:**
  - **Primary locators:** CSS selectors (generated initially)
  - **Fallback strategies:** XPath, text anchors, ARIA labels, visual anchors (image similarity)
  - **Locator storage:** Each UI element has 3-5 locator strategies stored (JSON array)
  - **Fallback order:** CSS → XPath → ARIA label → Text content → Visual anchor
- **DOM Fingerprinting:**
  - Page fingerprint captured: DOM tree hash, element count, structure signature
  - Known good state stored with passing test
  - On failure: Compare current page vs known good → detect if DOM changed
- **Confidence Scoring Model:**
  - **ML model:** Logistic regression predicting fix correctness (trained on historical data)
  - **Features:** Selector stability (how many fallbacks found), DOM similarity score, element position delta, text match strength
  - **Output:** 0-100% confidence score
  - **Color-coded:** Red <60% (reject/manual review), Yellow 60-85% (review suggested), Green >85% (high confidence, batch-approvable)
- **"Test the Test" Validation (From Architecture - Safety):**
  - After self-healing, inject known bug (revert code change)
  - Run healed test → must fail
  - If healed test passes with known bug → fix rejected (AI removed critical assertion)
  - This prevents "tests pass but app broken" scenario

**Playwright Containerization Architecture (From Architecture - Truth #5):**
- **Container Strategy:**
  - **Base image:** Playwright official Docker image (`mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:latest`)
  - **Customization:** Add QUALISYS test runner agent, tenant-scoped environment variables
  - **Isolation:** One container per test suite execution (tenant-scoped)
- **Pre-Warmed Pool (Mandatory, Not Optional):**
  - **Pool size:** Minimum 10 hot containers always running (idle, ready to execute)
  - **Max pool:** 100 containers (Kubernetes HPA scales based on queue depth)
  - **Startup optimization:** Containers pre-boot browsers (5-second warm start vs 120-second cold start)
  - **Cost trade-off:** $200/month for idle pool vs user experience (acceptable for MVP)
- **Kubernetes Orchestration:**
  - **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler):** Custom metric = test queue depth
  - **Scaling rules:** If queue >20 tests → scale up 10 pods, If queue <5 tests → scale down to min 10
  - **Resource limits:** 2GB RAM per pod, 1 CPU
  - **Spot instances:** Use AWS spot instances for non-production test runs (60% cost savings)
- **Execution Scheduling:**
  - **Priority queue:** P0 tests execute immediately, P1 within 5 minutes, P2 can wait 30 minutes
  - **Staggered scheduling:** Spread 9am surge across 8:30-9:30am window (prevent thundering herd)
  - **Tenant fairness:** No single tenant can monopolize runner pool (max 50% capacity)

**Self-Healing Approval Workflow Architecture (From Architecture - Priority 2):**
- **Production vs Staging Rules:**
  - **Production tests:** Mandatory PM/Admin approval (no auto-apply)
  - **Staging tests:** QA-Automation can approve (or auto-apply if confidence >90% and setting enabled)
  - **Development tests:** Auto-apply if confidence >80%
- **Approval UI (From UX Design - Flow 4):**
  - **3-column diff viewer:** Before screenshot | AI analysis | After screenshot
  - **Confidence score:** Large circular progress (94%), color-coded
  - **AI rationale:** Bullet points explaining why fix will work
  - **Actions:** Approve (green button), Reject (gray), Batch Apply to Similar (blue)
  - **Undo:** 24-hour rollback window (one-click revert)
- **Audit Trail:**
  - Every self-healing event logged: Timestamp, User who approved, Test name, Old selector, New selector, Confidence score, Outcome (passed/failed after healing)
  - Queryable dashboard: "Show all self-healing fixes in last 30 days"
  - Compliance-ready: Export audit trail as CSV/PDF for SOC 2 audits

**Real-Time Execution Architecture (From Architecture - Truth #4):**
- **Tech Choice:** Server-Sent Events (SSE), not WebSocket
- **Rationale:** One-way server→client sufficient for test progress updates, simpler than WebSocket
- **Update Frequency:** Every 5 seconds (sufficient granularity, users don't need millisecond updates)
- **Graceful Degradation:** If SSE connection drops → automatic polling fallback (10-second interval)
- **Test Execution Timeline UI (From UX Design - Pattern 4):**
  - **Visualization:** Horizontal swimlanes (Gantt-style chart)
  - **Each test:** Colored bar (Blue = running, Green = passed, Red = failed, Yellow = healing)
  - **Live updates:** Bars animate as tests execute
  - **Failed tests:** Pulse red to draw attention
  - **Click to expand:** Show logs, screenshots, self-healing status

**LLM Cost Control for Self-Healing (From Architecture - Priority 1):**
- **Self-healing uses LLM:** Selector proposal generation requires AI analysis
- **Cost mitigation:**
  - **Cache DOM analysis:** If same page structure seen before, reuse previous analysis (Redis, 7-day TTL)
  - **Batch processing:** Analyze 10 similar failures together (one LLM call, not 10)
  - **Fallback rules:** Simple CSS class renaming doesn't need LLM (regex pattern matching sufficient)
  - **Token budget:** Self-healing limited to 20% of tenant's token budget (test generation gets 80%)

### Stories (Estimated 14-16 stories)

**Story 4.1: Automated Test Execution Engine**

As a QA-Automation user, I want tests to run in parallel, so that execution is fast.
- AC1: Test runner analyzes test suite: 89 tests total
- AC2: Calculates parallelism: min(89 tests, 50 available containers) = 50 parallel executions
- AC3: Tests distributed across containers (round-robin allocation)
- AC4: Execution time: ~8 minutes for 89 tests (vs 90 minutes sequential)
- AC5: Parallel execution respects test dependencies (if test B depends on test A, run sequentially)
- **FRs Covered:** FR52

**Story 4.4: Real-Time Execution Progress UI**
As a QA-Automation user, I want to see real-time test execution progress, so that I know what's happening.
- AC1: Execution page shows Test Execution Timeline (horizontal swimlanes)
- AC2: Each test displayed as colored bar: Queued (gray) → Running (blue, animated) → Passed (green) / Failed (red)

- **FRs Covered:** FR55

**Story 4.6: Test Results Storage & Viewer**
As a QA-Automation user, I want to view test execution results with details, so that I can analyze failures.
- AC1: Test results page shows summary: "✅ 86 passed, ❌ 3 failed, Duration: 8m 32s"
- AC2: Passed tests list: Test name, Duration, Browser
- AC3: Failed tests list: Test name, Error message (truncated to 200 chars), Browser, Failure type (Assertion failed, Element not found, Timeout)
- AC4: Click failed test → Expand details: Full error stack trace, Screenshots gallery, Video player, Console logs
- AC5: "Re-run Failed" button available (re-executes only failed tests)
- AC6: Results stored permanently (queryable history: "Show all test runs for this project in last 30 days")
- **FRs Covered:** FR56

**Story 4.7: Re-Run Failed Tests**
As a QA-Automation user, I want to re-run failed tests individually or in batch, so that I can verify fixes quickly.
- AC1: Failed tests section shows "Re-run All Failed" button (batch) and "Re-run" button per test (individual)
- AC2: Click "Re-run All Failed" → Queues 3 failed tests for execution
- AC3: Re-run uses same settings (browser, mode, environment)
- AC4: Re-run results shown separately: "Re-run 1: 2 passed, 1 failed" (track fix progress)
- AC5: Test status history shown: "Original: Failed → Re-run 1: Failed → Re-run 2: Passed"
- **FRs Covered:** FR57

**Story 4.8: Multi-Strategy Locator Storage**
As the system, I want to store multiple locator strategies per UI element, so that self-healing can use fallbacks.
- AC1: During test generation (Epic 2), AutomationConsultant AI Agent generates 3-5 locators per element
- AC2: Locators stored in test script metadata (JSON array):
  ```json
  {
    "element": "submit_button",
    "locators": [
      {"strategy": "css", "value": "button.submit-btn", "priority": 1},
      {"strategy": "xpath", "value": "//button[@type='submit']", "priority": 2},
      {"strategy": "aria", "value": "button[aria-label='submit-order']", "priority": 3},
      {"strategy": "text", "value": "button:has-text('Submit Order')", "priority": 4}
    ]
  }
  ```
- AC3: Test runner tries primary locator first (CSS), falls back if fails
- AC4: Successful fallback logged: "Element found using XPath fallback (CSS failed)"
- **FRs Covered:** FR58

**Story 4.9: DOM Change Detection & Page Fingerprinting**
As the system, I want to detect when tests fail due to DOM changes, so that self-healing can trigger.
- AC1: When test passes, page fingerprint captured: DOM tree hash (MD5), element count, structure signature (JSON)
- AC2: Fingerprint stored with test execution record: "Known good state"
- AC3: When test fails, current page fingerprint captured
- AC4: Comparison: If fingerprint differs significantly (>30% structural change) → flag as "DOM change detected"
- AC5: Failure categorization:
  - **DOM change:** Fingerprint mismatch + locator not found → Self-healing candidate
  - **Assertion failure:** Fingerprint match + assertion failed → Actual bug (not self-healing)
  - **Timeout:** Fingerprint unknown (page didn't load) → Infrastructure issue (not self-healing)
- AC6: Self-healing candidates shown in separate dashboard section
- **FRs Covered:** FR59, FR60

**Story 4.10: Self-Healing Selector Proposal Engine**
As the system, I want to propose alternative locators when primary locators fail, so that tests can self-heal.
- AC1: When DOM change detected, Self-Healing Engine analyzes current page HTML
- AC2: Attempts fallback locators (stored in Story 4.8): XPath, ARIA, text
- AC3: For each fallback that successfully finds element:
  - Capture screenshot with element highlighted
  - Calculate confidence score (ML model): Position similarity, text match, ARIA match, DOM context similarity
- AC4: If no fallback works, generate new locator using LLM:
  - **Prompt:** "Page structure changed. Old locator: `.submit-btn`. New page HTML: [snippet]. Propose robust selector."
  - **LLM response:** New CSS/XPath selector
  - **Validation:** Test new selector on current page (must find element)
- AC5: Proposed fix stored:
  ```json
  {
    "test_id": "login-happy-path",
    "old_locator": "button.submit-btn",
    "new_locator": "button[aria-label='submit-order']",
    "confidence_score": 94,
    "rationale": ["Same text: 'Submit Order'", "Same position (bottom-right)", "Same ARIA label", "CSS class changed"],
    "before_screenshot": "s3://bucket/test-123/before.png",
    "after_screenshot": "s3://bucket/test-123/after.png"
  }
  ```
- **FRs Covered:** FR61

**Story 4.11: Confidence Scoring & Color-Coding**
As a QA-Automation user, I want to see confidence scores for proposed fixes, so that I can trust AI proposals.
- AC1: Confidence score displayed as large circular progress: "94%" (color-coded: Green >85%, Yellow 60-85%, Red <60%)
- AC2: Rationale bullets shown:
  - ✅ "Same text: 'Submit Order'" (high confidence signal)
  - ✅ "Same position: bottom-right of form" (high confidence)
  - ✅ "Same ARIA label: submit-order" (high confidence)
  - ⚠️ "CSS class changed: .submit-btn → .primary-action" (explains change)
- AC3: Red confidence (<60%): "Manual review required, auto-apply disabled"
- AC4: Yellow confidence (60-85%): "Review suggested" (can still approve)
- AC5: Green confidence (>85%): "High confidence, safe to batch apply"
- **FRs Covered:** FR62

**Story 4.12: Self-Healing Review Dashboard & Approval UI**
As a QA-Automation user, I want to review and approve self-healing proposals, so that I control test changes.
- AC1: Self-Healing Review Dashboard shows summary cards:
  - "9 tests need self-healing"
  - "6 high confidence (>85%)"
  - "3 medium confidence (70-85%)"
- AC2: "Auto-Apply High Confidence Fixes" button (applies 6 fixes immediately)
- AC3: "Review Medium Confidence" button (shows list for manual review)
- AC4: Click any test → Opens 3-column Diff Viewer:
  - **Left:** Before screenshot (failed state) with old locator highlighted
  - **Center:** AI analysis (confidence score, rationale bullets, what changed)
  - **Right:** After screenshot (current state) with new locator highlighted
- AC5: Actions:
  - "Approve & Apply" (green button) → Applies fix, re-runs test automatically
  - "Reject" (gray button) → Dismisses proposal, marks for manual fix
  - "Apply to Similar Cases" (blue button) → If 3 similar failures detected, batch apply same fix
- AC6: Approved fixes logged in audit trail
- **FRs Covered:** FR63

**Story 4.13: Apply Fixes & Auto Re-Run Tests**
As the system, I want to apply approved fixes and re-run tests automatically, so that healing is seamless.
- AC1: When user clicks "Approve & Apply":
  - Test script updated: Old locator replaced with new locator
  - New version created (version 2, version 3, etc.)
  - Git-style diff stored: "- button.submit-btn / + button[aria-label='submit-order']"
- AC2: Test automatically re-queued for execution (same browser, mode, environment)
- AC3: Re-run executes within 1 minute (priority queue)
- AC4: Re-run result:
  - If passed: "✅ Self-healed successfully" (green toast notification)
  - If failed: "❌ Self-healing fix didn't work, manual intervention needed" (red notification, roll back change)
- AC5: Success rate tracked: "94% of approved fixes resulted in passing tests"
- **FRs Covered:** FR64

**Story 4.14: Self-Healing Audit Trail & Rollback**
As a QA-Automation/PM user, I want to see audit trail of all self-healing changes with rollback capability, so that I have control and transparency.
- AC1: "Self-Healing History" dashboard shows all fixes:
  - Table: Date, Test name, User who approved, Old locator, New locator, Confidence score, Outcome (Passed/Failed after fix)
- AC2: Filters: Date range, Test name, User, Outcome
- AC3: Export as CSV/PDF for compliance audits
- AC4: Each fix shows "Undo" button (available for 24 hours after applied)
- AC5: Click "Undo" → Reverts test script to previous version, shows warning: "Test will fail again unless DOM reverted"
- AC6: Undo action logged in audit trail (compliance: who reverted, when, why)
- **FRs Covered:** FR65

**Story 4.15: Production vs Staging Approval Workflows**
As a PM/Admin, I want to configure approval workflows for production tests, so that critical tests require manual approval.
- AC1: Settings → Self-Healing → Approval Workflows
- AC2: Configuration per environment:
  - **Production tests:** Dropdown (Require PM approval, Require Admin approval, Require QA-Automation approval)
  - **Staging tests:** Dropdown (QA-Automation can approve, Auto-apply if confidence >90%, Manual review always)
  - **Development tests:** Dropdown (Auto-apply if >80%, Manual review always)
- AC3: "Production" flag set per test (test metadata: `environment: production`)
- AC4: If production test needs healing + setting = "Require PM approval" → PM receives email notification, must approve in dashboard
- AC5: Approval workflow enforced: Cannot auto-apply production test fixes without configured approval
- AC6: Audit trail captures approver: "PM Sarah Chen approved production fix at 2025-12-15 14:32"
- **FRs Covered:** FR66

**Story 4.16: "Test the Test" Validation (Safety)**
As the system, I want to validate healed tests still detect real bugs, so that self-healing doesn't remove critical assertions.
- AC1: After self-healing fix applied, "test the test" validation runs automatically
- AC2: Validation logic:
  - Known bug injected: Revert UI change that caused original failure (e.g., restore old CSS class `.submit-btn`)
  - Run healed test against "buggy" version
  - **Expected:** Test should fail (because bug still exists)
  - **If test passes:** Fix rejected (AI likely removed assertion or made test too lenient)
- AC3: Validation result shown in approval UI:
  - ✅ "Validation passed: Healed test still catches bugs"
  - ❌ "Validation failed: Healed test no longer detects original issue (fix rejected)"
- AC4: Failed validation → Fix auto-rejected, escalated to manual review with warning
- AC5: Validation success rate tracked: "98% of healed tests pass validation"
- **FRs Covered:** N/A (safety mechanism, preventive architecture)

### Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Self-Healing Accuracy Failures (From Pre-mortem - CRITICAL, Score 9)**
- **Scenario:** Self-healing "fixes" tests by removing assertions, all tests pass but bugs ship to production
- **Impact:** Customer ships critical bug, blames QUALISYS, legal liability, reputation destroyed
- **Mitigation (Implemented in Stories 4.16, 4.15):**
  - "Test the test" validation (Story 4.16): Healed test must fail when known bug introduced
  - Conservative confidence thresholds: <60% auto-rejected, 60-85% requires review, >85% safe but still validated
  - Mandatory approval for production tests (Story 4.15)
  - Comprehensive audit trail (Story 4.14): 24-hour rollback window, all changes logged
  - User testing: 10 real UI change scenarios tested before Epic 4 complete (validate 90%+ accuracy)

**Risk 2: User Trust in AI Proposals (From SWOT - W3)**
- **Scenario:** Users don't trust self-healing proposals, manually review every fix, defeating automation purpose
- **Impact:** Value proposition undermined ("AI testing" feels like "AI suggestions I have to verify manually")
- **Mitigation:**
  - Transparency: Show AI rationale bullets (why fix will work)
  - Confidence scores: Color-coded (green = safe, yellow = caution, red = danger)
  - Incremental trust building: Start with staging/dev tests (lower risk), graduate to production after success
  - Success metrics displayed: "94% of fixes result in passing tests" (build confidence with data)
  - Batch approval for high confidence: One click fixes 10 similar failures (efficiency wins trust)

**Risk 3: Playwright Container Costs at Scale (From Architecture - W4, Score 6)**
- **Scenario:** 500 tenants × 50 parallel tests = 25,000 containers needed, AWS bill hits $50K/month
- **Impact:** Unit economics broken, forced price increase, customer churn
- **Mitigation:**
  - Pre-warmed pool optimization: 10-50 hot containers (not 25,000), scale on-demand
  - Kubernetes HPA with intelligent scaling: Scale up when queue depth >20, scale down when <5
  - Spot instances: 60% cost savings for non-production tests (AWS spot instances)
  - Execution scheduling: Stagger 9am surge across 30-minute window (prevent thundering herd)
  - Cost monitoring dashboard: Real-time infrastructure spend per tenant, alert at 80% budget
  - Tenant quotas: Free tier = 100 tests/month, Pro tier = 1000 tests/month, Enterprise = unlimited

**Risk 4: LLM Hallucination in Selector Proposals (From SWOT - W2, Score 7)**
- **Scenario:** LLM generates invalid CSS selector (syntax error) or selector that finds wrong element
- **Impact:** Self-healing proposals fail validation, user loses trust, manual intervention required
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Fallback-first strategy:** Try stored fallback locators (Story 4.8) before LLM call (80% of cases don't need LLM)
  - **LLM validation:** Test proposed selector on live page before showing to user (syntax validation + element found check)
  - **Confidence scoring:** LLM-generated selectors get lower confidence score than fallback matches (requires manual review)
  - **Caching:** If LLM proposed selector for similar DOM change before, reuse cached proposal (avoid re-generating)
  - **Token budget:** Limit LLM self-healing to 20% of tenant budget (test generation gets priority)

**Risk 5: False Positive DOM Change Detection (From Risk Matrix - Medium, Score 5)**
- **Scenario:** Page loads slowly, DOM fingerprint captured mid-load, flagged as "DOM changed" incorrectly
- **Impact:** Self-healing triggers unnecessarily, user reviews proposals for non-issues, wastes time
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Wait for page load:** Fingerprint captured only after `DOMContentLoaded` event (not mid-render)
  - **Fingerprint stability:** Capture fingerprint 2x (1 second apart), must match (detect dynamic content)
  - **Similarity threshold:** >30% structural change required to flag DOM change (not 5% minor differences)
  - **Failure type validation:** Only trigger self-healing if "Element not found" error (not assertion failures)
  - **Monitoring:** Track false positive rate, alert if >10% (indicates detection logic needs tuning)

**Risk 6: Real-Time UI Performance Degradation (From Architecture - Failure Mode 8, Score 6)**
- **Scenario:** 500 concurrent users watching test execution dashboards, SSE connections overload server
- **Impact:** Dashboards freeze, users see stale data, complaints about "slow platform"
- **Mitigation:**
  - **SSE not WebSocket:** Simpler, stateless servers, easier horizontal scaling
  - **Update throttling:** 5-second update interval (not millisecond), reduces server load 200x
  - **Graceful degradation:** If SSE connection fails, automatic polling fallback (10-second interval)
  - **Connection limits:** Max 1000 concurrent SSE connections per server instance, queue excess connections
  - **Load testing:** Simulate 1000+ concurrent users before Epic 4 complete (validate performance)
  - **Horizontal scaling:** Kubernetes HPA scales SSE servers based on active connection count

### Epic Completion Criteria

Before moving to Epic 5, Epic 4 must achieve:
- ✅ All 14-16 stories 100% complete
- ✅ **Breakthrough Demo:** Upload PRD → Generate tests → Execute automated tests → UI changes → Self-healing detects and proposes fixes → Approve → Tests heal and pass - complete flow in <15 minutes
- ✅ **Self-healing accuracy:** 90%+ of approved fixes result in passing tests (validated with 50 real UI change scenarios)
- ✅ **Confidence scoring:** High confidence (>85%) fixes have 95%+ success rate, medium (60-85%) have 80%+ success rate
- ✅ **"Test the test" validation:** 98%+ of healed tests still fail when known bug introduced (safety proven)
- ✅ **Performance:** 100 automated tests execute in <10 minutes (50 parallel runners, P95 latency <30s per test)
- ✅ **User trust:** 70%+ of QA-Automation users approve at least one self-healing fix in first week of usage
- ✅ **Cost control:** Infrastructure costs <$5 per 100 test executions (including Playwright containers, LLM calls)
- ✅ **Integration:** Self-healing results update GitHub PR status, JIRA issues updated when tests pass (FR84)
- ✅ **Audit trail:** All self-healing changes logged, exportable as CSV/PDF for compliance
- ✅ **Regression tests:** Epic 1-3 still working (auth, projects, manual testing, GitHub integration)
- ✅ **Deployed to staging**
- ✅ **Stakeholder validation:** Demonstrated to 5 stakeholders (QA-Automation persona primary), "magic moment" reaction achieved
- ✅ **Competitive differentiation validated:** No competitor has self-healing with this level of sophistication (confidence scoring, multi-strategy fallback, "test the test" validation)

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Dashboard Data Architecture (From UX Design - Flow 5):**
- **Real-time metrics:** SSE updates every 5 seconds for live test execution data
- **Historical aggregation:** Pre-computed metrics (coverage %, velocity, defect leakage) via daily batch jobs
- **Per-persona optimization:** Separate API endpoints per dashboard (PM dashboard != QA dashboard)
- **Caching strategy:** Redis cache for expensive aggregations (1-hour TTL), invalidate on test execution complete
- **Export format:** Recharts visualization → React-PDF rendering → S3 storage → Download link

**TestRail/Testworthy Integration Architecture (From Architecture - Priority 5):**
- **Adapter Pattern:** Unified TestManagementAdapter interface supporting multiple providers
  - `TestRailAdapter implements TestManagementAdapter`
  - `TestworthyAdapter implements TestManagementAdapter`
  - Future: Add Zephyr, qTest, Xray (extensible)
- **Import Strategy:**
  - Batch import: Paginate API calls (100 test cases per page)
  - Preserve IDs: Store external_id (TestRail ID) in QUALISYS test metadata
  - Folder structure: Map TestRail sections → QUALISYS folders (hierarchical)
  - Conflict resolution: If test already exists, update (not duplicate)
- **Export Strategy:**
  - Mapping: QUALISYS test → TestRail test case (custom fields for Playwright script path)
  - Create in TestRail: POST /add_case API
  - Store mapping: QUALISYS test_id ↔ TestRail case_id (bi-directional reference)
- **Bi-Directional Sync:**
  - **QUALISYS → TestRail:** Test execution complete → POST /add_result (pass/fail status, duration, screenshots)
  - **TestRail → QUALISYS:** Webhook (test case updated) → Update QUALISYS test metadata
  - **Sync frequency:** Real-time (via webhooks), fallback polling every 15 minutes
  - **Conflict resolution:** Last write wins (timestamp-based)

**Slack Integration Architecture (From UX Design - Flow 6):**
- **OAuth Flow:** Slack OAuth 2.0 (user approves workspace access)
- **Bot Scopes:** `chat:write` (send messages), `commands` (slash commands), `channels:read` (list channels)
- **Notification Types:**
  - **Test completion:** "🤖 QUALISYS: Test run completed" (pass/fail summary, duration, link)
  - **Test failure:** "❌ QUALISYS: 3 tests failed" (test names, error snippets, self-healing available)
  - **SLA breach:** "⚠️ SLA BREACH: P1 defect open >24 hours" (defect link, assignee, age)
- **ChatOps Commands:**
  - `/qualisys status` → Show recent test runs summary
  - `/qualisys run <test-suite>` → Trigger test execution (queues background job)
  - `/qualisys help` → List available commands
- **Rate Limiting:** Max 1 message per channel per minute (prevent spam)
- **Graceful Degradation:** If Slack API fails → Fall back to email notification (user still informed)

**Email Notification Architecture (From FR109):**
- **Scheduled Summaries:**
  - **Daily digest:** Sent at user-configured time (default 9am), includes: Tests run yesterday, Pass/fail summary, New defects filed, Coverage change
  - **Weekly digest:** Sent Monday 9am, includes: Tests run last 7 days, Velocity trend, Defect leakage, SLA compliance status
- **Real-Time Alerts:**
  - **Test failure:** P0/P1 tests failed → Email within 5 minutes (configurable severity threshold)
  - **SLA breach:** P1 defect open >24 hours → Email immediately
- **Email Service:** SendGrid (MVP), plan Amazon SES for scale (cost optimization)
- **Template Engine:** React Email (type-safe HTML emails)
- **Unsubscribe:** One-click unsubscribe link (required by CAN-SPAM Act)

**Flaky Test Detection (FR73 - Novel Feature):**
- **Definition:** Test passes/fails inconsistently (e.g., passes 7 of 10 runs)
- **Detection Algorithm:**
  - Track last 20 executions per test
  - Calculate flake rate: failures / total runs
  - If flake rate 10-50% → Flag as flaky
  - If flake rate >50% → Flag as broken (not flaky)
- **Quarantine Feature:**
  - Flaky tests quarantined: Excluded from pass/fail counts (don't block PRs)
  - Badge shown: "⚠️ Quarantined (flaky)" on test card
  - Re-enable after fixing: User clicks "Mark as Fixed" → Run 10 times → If pass rate 100% → Remove quarantine
- **Root Cause Hints:**
  - Timing issue: "Test uses hardcoded wait (2 seconds)"
  - Race condition: "Test interacts with async element"
  - External dependency: "Test calls external API (unstable)"

- AC3: "Configure" button per integration → Opens configuration modal
- AC4: "Disconnect" button → Removes integration (confirmation required), data preserved in QUALISYS (not deleted)
- AC5: "API Keys" section → Manage API keys for programmatic access to QUALISYS
- AC6: Health dashboard: Shows integration uptime, error rate, last successful sync
- **FRs Covered:** FR110

### Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: TestRail/Testworthy Sync Complexity (From Architecture - Priority 5, Score 6)**
- **Scenario:** TestRail API changes, sync breaks, data corruption during bi-directional updates
- **Impact:** Tests out of sync between platforms, users lose trust, manual reconciliation required
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Adapter pattern:** Abstract TestRail-specific logic, easy to update when API changes
  - **Conflict resolution:** Last write wins (timestamp-based), preserve both versions in audit log
  - **Validation:** Before sync, validate data integrity (no missing required fields)
  - **Dead letter queue:** Failed sync events stored (7-day retention), manual replay capability
  - **Health monitoring:** Integration dashboard shows sync status, error rate, alerts if >1% failures

**Risk 2: Email Delivery Failures (From Risk Matrix - Medium, Score 4)**
- **Scenario:** SendGrid rate limit hit, emails bounce, end up in spam folders
- **Impact:** Users miss critical alerts (P1 failures, SLA breaches), compliance issues
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Email service quotas:** Monitor SendGrid usage, alert at 80% daily limit
  - **Bounce handling:** Track bounced emails, disable sending to invalid addresses
  - **Spam prevention:** SPF/DKIM/DMARC configured, avoid spam trigger words, unsubscribe link included
  - **Fallback:** If SendGrid fails, queue for retry (exponential backoff), escalate to Slack notification
  - **Delivery tracking:** Monitor open rates (target >40%), click rates (target >10%)

**Risk 3: Slack Rate Limiting (From Integration Architecture - Score 5)**
- **Scenario:** 100 test runs complete simultaneously, 100 Slack messages sent, rate limit hit (1 msg/second)
- **Impact:** Messages delayed or dropped, users complain "didn't receive notification"
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Message batching:** If 10 test runs complete within 1 minute, send 1 summary message (not 10 individual)
  - **Rate limiting:** Max 1 message per channel per minute (configured in code)
  - **Queuing:** If rate limit hit, queue messages (FIFO), retry after 60 seconds
  - **Priority queue:** SLA breach alerts sent immediately, test completion notifications can wait
  - **Fallback:** If Slack API fails, send email notification (user still informed)

**Risk 4: Dashboard Performance with Large Data Sets (From Architecture - Scalability, Score 5)**
- **Scenario:** Org has 1M test executions, dashboard queries take 30+ seconds
- **Impact:** Dashboard feels slow, users frustrated, SSE connections timeout
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Pre-aggregation:** Batch jobs pre-compute metrics (coverage %, velocity) daily, store in cache
  - **Redis caching:** Cache expensive queries (1-hour TTL), invalidate on test execution complete
  - **Pagination:** Limit query results (e.g., show last 100 test runs, not all 1M)
  - **Database indexes:** Index frequently queried columns (test_id, org_id, created_at, status)
  - **Lazy loading:** Load dashboard widgets on-demand (not all at once), progressive enhancement

**Risk 5: Flaky Test False Positives (From Novel Feature - Score 4)**
- **Scenario:** Test flakes due to infrastructure issue (runner timeout), flagged as "flaky test" incorrectly
- **Impact:** Real test issues dismissed as flakiness, bugs missed
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Root cause hints:** Analyze failure patterns (timeout always? selector always? random?) before flagging
  - **Quarantine review:** Manual review required before quarantine (not automatic)
  - **Re-enable validation:** After "fixed", run test 10x, require 100% pass rate to remove quarantine
  - **Monitoring:** Track quarantined test count, alert if >10% of suite quarantined (indicates systemic issue)

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Agent SDK Architecture (From SWOT - O5):**
- **Language support:** TypeScript (primary), Python (secondary)
- **SDK provides:**
  - `AgentBase` class to extend
  - Context access: Documents, code, DOM, previous agent outputs
  - Tool use: File read/write, LLM calls, HTTP requests
  - Output schema: Structured JSON (validated)
- **Sandboxing:** Agents run in isolated containers (security: prevent malicious code)
- **Marketplace submission:**
  - Submit agent source code → Automated security scan → Manual review → Approval → Published
  - Revenue share: 70% to creator, 30% to QUALISYS
- **Versioning:** Semantic versioning (1.0.0), backward compatibility enforced

**SAML 2.0 SSO Architecture (Enterprise Feature):**
- **Identity Providers supported:** Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin, Google Workspace
- **SAML flow:** SP-initiated (user clicks "Login with SSO" → redirected to IdP → SAML assertion → redirected back)
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning:** User doesn't exist in QUALISYS → Created automatically from SAML attributes
- **Attribute mapping:** SAML attributes → QUALISYS user fields (email, name, role)
- **Multi-tenant:** Each org configures own IdP (not global SAML config)

**Self-Hosted LLM Architecture (From Architecture - Priority 1):**
- **Development:** Ollama (easy setup, local MacBooks, no GPU needed)
- **Production:** vLLM (GPU-optimized, 10x faster inference than Ollama)
- **Model support:** Llama 3, Mistral, CodeLlama, custom fine-tuned models
- **Provider abstraction:** LLMProvider interface (OpenAI, Anthropic, SelfHosted)
- **Failover strategy:** Primary (OpenAI) → Secondary (Anthropic) → Tertiary (Self-hosted)
- **Cost tracking:** Self-hosted costs = GPU infrastructure, not LLM tokens (different economic model)

**SOC 2 Compliance Architecture (Enterprise Requirement):**
- **Control objectives:** Security, availability, confidentiality
- **Audit trail:** All actions logged (immutable, append-only logs), 7-year retention
- **Access control:** RBAC enforced, least privilege principle
- **Encryption:** TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest
- **Incident response:** Documented procedures, breach notification within 72 hours
- **Vendor management:** Sub-processor list (AWS, SendGrid, OpenAI), DPAs signed

### Epic 6+ Stories (Examples - Not Exhaustive)

**Story 6.9: Agent Registry Service (NEW — from Agent Extensibility Framework Tech Spec)**
As a platform administrator, I want to register, discover, and manage agent definitions at runtime, so that new agents can be added to QUALISYS without code deployment.
- AC1: `agent_definitions` and `agent_versions` tables created via Alembic migration. 7 built-in agents seeded (idempotent). `agent_execution_log` partitioned by month (1yr hot, 7yr cold archive aligned with SOC 2).
- AC2: `AgentRegistry` service: register(), get(), discover(), disable(), list_all(). Redis cache (1h TTL), invalidated on mutation.
- AC3: `AgentOrchestrator` resolves from registry (not hardcoded config). 404 if not found/disabled. Zero regression for existing 7 agents.
- AC4: Admin CRUD API at `/api/v1/admin/agents` (owner/admin only). Pydantic validation.
- AC5: Discovery API at `GET /api/v1/agents` — tenant+role filtered, excludes system_prompt (metadata only). Cached 5 min.
- AC6: Version management — auto-increment, rollout_percentage (0-100), previous versions retained.
- **Tech Spec:** `docs/planning/tech-spec-agent-extensibility-framework.md` Section 5, Story 6.5a
- **Depends on:** None (foundation story)

**Story 6.10: Per-Tenant Agent Customization (NEW — from Agent Extensibility Framework Tech Spec)**
As a tenant administrator, I want to customize agent behavior for my organization (prompts, output templates, enable/disable), so that agents are tailored to my industry and testing requirements.
- AC1: `tenant_agent_configs` table with unique (tenant_id, agent_id). Public schema, RLS-ready.
- AC2: `AgentConfigResolver` merges global + tenant overrides. Priority: tenant pin > tenant override > global default. Prompt merge: append/prepend/replace. Cached 5 min.
- AC3: Custom prompt (max 10,000 chars). Append mode adds after "## Client-Specific Instructions" header.
- AC4: Per-tenant enable/disable. Disabled agents hidden from discovery. No cross-tenant impact.
- AC5: LLM provider/model override per agent per tenant. Only platform-configured providers accepted.
- AC6: Tenant config CRUD API at `/api/v1/tenant/agents/{agent_id}/config` (tenant owner/admin only).

- **Depends on:** Story 6.9

**Story 6.11: Agent Isolation & Circuit Breakers (NEW — from Agent Extensibility Framework Tech Spec)**
As a platform operator, I want per-agent fault isolation (token budgets, timeouts, circuit breakers), so that one misbehaving agent cannot degrade the platform for other agents or tenants.
- AC1: Per-agent daily token budget (Redis atomic counters). HTTP 429 on exceeded. Default: max_tokens × 100/day.
- AC2: Per-agent hard timeout (default: 120s). HTTP 504 on timeout. Prometheus metric emitted.
- AC3: Per-agent circuit breaker (closed/open/half-open). Opens after 5 failures in 120s window. HTTP 503 when open. Redis state. Prometheus metric on state change.
- AC4: `AgentExecutionGuard` wraps all three layers. Integrated into orchestrator. Feature flag `AGENT_EXECUTION_GUARD_ENABLED` for canary rollout (start with 1 agent, then enable globally).
- AC5: Admin API for manual circuit breaker reset. Audit logged.
- AC6: Grafana "Agent Health" dashboard: circuit breaker status, token consumption, timeout/error rates. PagerDuty P2 on circuit open, Slack on token budget >90%.
- **Tech Spec:** `docs/planning/tech-spec-agent-extensibility-framework.md` Section 7, Story 6.5c
- **Depends on:** Story 6.9

**Story 6.12: Agent Prompt Versioning & Gradual Rollout (NEW — from Agent Extensibility Framework Tech Spec)**
As a platform administrator, I want to version agent prompts and roll out changes gradually, so that prompt improvements can be validated before affecting all tenants.
- AC1: Create new version via API/UI. Requires system_prompt + changelog. Auto-incremented semver. Previous versions retained.
- AC2: Gradual rollout via `rollout_percentage` (default: 10). Deterministic tenant bucketing (hash(tenant_id) % 100).
- AC3: Version resolution: tenant pin > rollout-weighted latest > stable latest. Version logged in execution log.
- AC4: Rollback: set rollout_percentage=0. Deprecate/retire lifecycle. Auto-upgrade pinned tenants on retirement (with notification).
- AC5: Grafana version comparison panel: error rate, token usage, execution time by version.
- AC6: Admin UI: Versions tab per agent — version list, rollout slider, changelog, "Create New Version" button.
- **Tech Spec:** `docs/planning/tech-spec-agent-extensibility-framework.md` Section 8, Story 6.5d
- **Depends on:** Story 6.9

## 10. Epic 7 — Agent Skills Integration

**Duration:** 4-5 weeks (4 phases)
**Primary Personas:** All agent users, Platform Admins
**Risk Level:** 🟢 Low-Medium (Score 3-4) — POC validates before full commitment; zero-regression fallback architecture
**Dependencies:** Epic 6 (Advanced Agents must exist before Skills can optimize them)
**PRD Reference:** `docs/planning/prd-agent-skills-integration.md`
**Architecture Board:** APPROVED with 5 conditions (2026-02-15)

### Objective

Integrate Anthropic's Agent Skills framework into QUALISYS's multi-agent system using a three-level progressive disclosure model. Reduce LLM token costs by 40-60% per agent invocation while enabling modular agent architecture and 2-4 week skill development cycles (vs 8-12 week agent rebuilds).

### Functional Requirements Coverage

**Skill Registry Service (FR-SK1–SK7):** Centralized skill metadata, discovery, versioning, lifecycle management
**Skill Proxy Service (FR-SK8–SK14):** Skill execution via Claude API, context translation, tenant isolation, fallback
**Skill Adapter Library (FR-SK15–SK18):** LangChain ↔ Claude API translation, skill chaining
**Governance Extensions (FR-SK19–SK23):** Risk classification, deployment approval, execution gates
**Agent Orchestrator Modifications (FR-SK24–SK28):** Skill discovery, selection, mixed execution, backward compatibility

**Total FRs in Epic 7:** 28 FRs (FR-SK1 through FR-SK28)

### Value Delivered

**Token Cost Reduction:**
- BAConsultant: ~25,000 tokens → ~6,000 tokens (**76% reduction**)
- QAConsultant: ~20,000 tokens → ~5,500 tokens (**72% reduction**)
- AutomationConsultant: ~22,000 tokens → ~6,500 tokens (**70% reduction**)

## 12. Critical Success Factors & Risk Prioritization

### Critical Success Factors

**For MVP Success (Epics 1-5):**
1. **Self-healing accuracy:** 90%+ is mandatory, not optional (defines differentiation)
2. **Integration resilience:** JIRA/GitHub/Slack must be rock-solid (80% of value)
3. **Multi-tenant isolation:** Zero cross-tenant data leakage (trust destroyed if fails)
4. **Cost control:** LLM token budgets enforced from day one (prevents economic disaster)
5. **Fresh chat pattern:** Use fresh chats for Epic 2-5 workflows (avoid context limitations)

**For Enterprise Adoption (Epic 6):**
1. **SOC 2 compliance:** Non-negotiable for Fortune 500 deals
2. **SAML SSO:** Standard enterprise requirement (80%+ of enterprise RFPs)
3. **Self-hosted option:** Growing requirement (data sovereignty, compliance, cost)
4. **Agent platform:** Runtime registry + per-tenant customization enables admin-configured custom agents per client request without code deployment (Stories 6.9-6.12)
5. **Agent marketplace:** Network effects create competitive moat (Story 6.5, depends on 6.9)
6. **Extensibility:** API-first design enables ecosystem growth

**For Cost Optimization (Epic 7):**
1. **Agent Skills POC:** Validate 40%+ token reduction before full investment (Story 7.5 go/no-go gate)
2. **Progressive disclosure:** Three-level skill loading critical for margin improvement at scale
3. **Zero regression:** Full-context fallback mandatory — skills optimize, never hard-depend
4. **Governance integrity:** All 15 human-in-the-loop gates maintained with skill-based execution

### Risk Prioritization

| # | Level | Risk | Epic | Mitigation Strategy |
|:-:|:-----:|------|:----:|---------------------|
| 1 | :red_circle: **Critical** | Self-healing accuracy failures | 4 | Story 4.16 "Test the Test" mandatory |
| 2 | :red_circle: **Critical** | Multi-tenant data leakage | 1 | Schema-level isolation non-negotiable |
| 3 | :red_circle: **Critical** | LLM cost explosion | 2 | Token budgets + aggressive caching |
| 4 | :orange_circle: **High** | GitHub/JIRA integration brittleness | 2–3 | Dead letter queues required |
| 5 | :orange_circle: **High** | Playwright container costs at scale | 4 | Pre-warmed pool + spot instances |
| 6 | :yellow_circle: **Medium** | User trust in self-healing proposals | 4 | Transparency + confidence scores |
| 7 | :yellow_circle: **Medium** | TestRail sync complexity | 5 | Adapter pattern for maintainability |
| 8 | :yellow_circle: **Medium** | Email/Slack delivery failures | 5 | Fallback mechanisms (email ↔ Slack) |
