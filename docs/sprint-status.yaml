    by: "AI Senior Developer Review"
    notes: "8/8 ACs implemented, 21/21 tasks verified complete. 1 MEDIUM finding: artifacts.metadata JSONB column never populated by orchestrator._create_artifact() — metadata.tokens_used would be NULL in production. 5 LOW advisory notes (stale docstrings, missing version endpoint integration tests, BDD retry gap, ArtifactCard fetch pattern). Status: review → in-progress."
